# WebNotificationManager
Due to the shutdown, Playstation 5 consoles will be only online available. With this notification script I will get an alert if it is orderable.
Usage:
  Just setup your config. There are 2 ways for checking if a site has changed:
  1. Pattern search: If you define the pattern attribute beside the url attribute, the script looks for the pattern on the site.
  2. File watch: IF you define the file attribute beside the url attribute, the script looks if the site has changed in general.

Use following command to install packages on a synnology NAS:
`python3 -m pip install [package]`
